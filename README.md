# jht-chess
-----------------------------------------

This program ships a chessengine and an interface to play against it.

Installing
------------------------------------
First you need to install Linux on your computer.
You have to install libncurses5-dev (it is recommended to do this with your distribution's packetmanager, e.g "# apt-get install libncurses5-dev" or "# pacman -S libncurses5-dev").
Then you can compile the program (run "$ make" in your terminal when you're in the the "jht-chess_vX.X.X"-folder) or make the file "jht-chess" executable ( run "$ chmod +x jht-chess" in your terminal).

Now you should be able to run "jht-chess ( "# ./jht-chess" , you have to do this as root or with sudo).
